# Introduction
The UL SmartStripe probe is a USB-connected device that emulates a magnetic stripe card. It is intended to be used for the testing and certification of payment card acceptance devices.
The SmartStripe probe command line utility allows users of the SmartStripe probe to integrate the SmartStripe probe in third-party software. For interoperability reasons this utility is distributed as an open source project.
